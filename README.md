# Fallout: Emergence

Fallout: Emergence is a terminal-based interactive adventure game built in Python.  
The player navigates branching story decisions, skill checks, and multiple endings based on S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats.

This project demonstrates structured application design, modular functions, input validation, and state-driven logic.
