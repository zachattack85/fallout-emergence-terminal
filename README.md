# Fallout: Emergence – A Text-Based Adventure

Fallout: Emergence is a modular, terminal-based interactive adventure game built in Python.

The player navigates branching story decisions, skill checks, and multiple endings based on S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats.

This project demonstrates structured application design, modular organization, input validation, and state-driven game logic.
